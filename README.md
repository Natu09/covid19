# Covid-19 Web Application

Library for plots and dashboard.

## Setup

1. Set up your own virtual enviroment, I personally use miniconda (https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html), but pythons virtual envs work just fine (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)

2. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Building

To build this library, ensure you are in a virtual enviroment, and install the requirements from the main directory.

Run the following command from this directory:

```
python3 app.py
```

The geo plots take a quite bit of time to load the data, so it might take a few minutes to launch.
